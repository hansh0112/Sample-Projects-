 Game is planned + coded by me for fun and practice 
 Twitter-search is a console based search that uses python-twitter, httplib2, simplejson, python-oauth2 dependencies and
 the base code is from openhatch.org. It uses twitter API keys - didn't include in file. This searches tweets by keyword, find trending topics,
 show tweets based on username
